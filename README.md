uGolf Development

Serial Communication over UART[B9600] Between the Pi and the M8P-2-11 Works like a charm and is implementet within the SerialManager Class.
Basic Data management Functionality has been implemented within the DataManager Class.

Current Implementation Design foresees the MainWindow Class as Bay for further Implementations.

# M8P-2-11 Configuration
[NMEA] High Precision
[Port] UART 1 [ALL Possible NMEA Protocolls]
Further Details about how to configure the Chip over u-Blox u-Center will follow in future

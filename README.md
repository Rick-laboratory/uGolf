# Furthermore Implementation Details, subject to change for an improoving experience.
Serial Communication over UART[B9600] Between the Pi and the M8P-2-11 Works like a charm and is implementet within the SerialManager Class.<br>
Basic Data management Functionality has been implemented within the DataManager Class.<br>
<br>
Current Implementation Design foresees the MainWindow Class as Bay for further Implementations.

# M8P-2-11 Configuration
[NMEA] High Precision <br>
[Port] UART 1 [ALL Possible NMEA Protocolls]<br>
Details about how to configure the Chip over u-Blox u-Center will follow in future
